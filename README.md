# Infinibattle 2022 Bot "Kapitein Hoek"

Simplistic strategy for the ["L-Game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_game) (with scoring points for corner positions) Infinibattle edition.

## Description

After two editions of the Infinibattle (in-house bot-programming challenge at Infi) where I wrote a bot that was designed to fail, this year there's actually an attempt at winning!

Kapitein Hoek ("Captain Hook", but "Hoek" literally means "corner") will make a light attempt at winning.
It deviates only slightly from the starter bot by (A) moving our own piece into a corner as lightly as possible, and (B) occupying further corners with neutral pieces.
Not a match for real bots from colleagues, but at the least a challenge.
